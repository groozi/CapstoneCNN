## Capstone Project - Convolutional Neural Network

This project was designed to address a problem of the visually impaired in identifying fruits and vegetables. The solution to the problem was to design a machine learning model to classify image input data and identify the fruit or vegetable present in the image. The overall goal is to create a tool where someone visually impaired can take a photo of a piece of produce and have the application audibly tell what is presented in the photo.  

The model created is a convolutional neural network. This model architecture was chosen because convolutional neural networks are well-suited for working with spatial input data, such as images. The CNN works with a dataset obtained from Kaggle.
